            <p>Once all necessary ingredients are gathered, here is the process we'll use to make brown sugar oat pancakes:</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>    
            <ol>
                <h2><li><strong>Combine the ingredients:</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    Whisk together the egg, oil, and buttermilk in one bowl. 
                    In the other bowl, combine salt, baking soda, brown sugar, all-purpose flour, and whole wheat flour. 
                    Add the bowl of dry ingredients to the wet ingredient bowl, and whisk together until all ingredients are fully integrated. 
                    Next, add the oats to the mixture and whisk them in.
                </p>
                <h2><li><strong>Baking your pancakes:</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    Now take your griddle, and heat it to 275 degrees Farenheight. 
                    It will be ready once water starts slowly sizzling when sprinkled on the surface. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we are ready to cook some pancakes!! Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for every pancake 
                    (you can make them larger, this is just what I use.) 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to add chocolate chips, blueberries, walnuts, etc. this is the time to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let them cook until bubbles leave visible pocketmarks on the surface of the pancakes when they pop. 
                    At this point, flip them, and let them cook the rest of the way through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pancakes should come out golden-brown on both sides and roughly 1/4 in. thick. 
                    If they are darker and too thin your temperature is too high, 
                    and if they are too thick or didn't cook all the way through, your temperature is too low.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once your dough has risen for the hour, gently squish it down, it should end up losing about half its volume. 
                    Take the dough and drop it on a clean counter with a sprinkling of flour. 
                    Now separate your dough in 7 to 8 secitons with roughly the same size (I do this part by hand, but it would be easier with a dough cutter.) 
                    Roll these sections into smaller balls, and cover with a towel and let rest for about ten minutes.
                </p>
                <h2><li><strong>cooking your naan</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    While your naan is resting this final time is the best time to prepare to cook your naan. 
                    Put your cast iron on the stovetop, and bring it up to a medium high heat. 
                    You will know when your skillet is ready when you sprinkle it with a small splash of water and it instanly sizzles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, roll your naan bread to a disc that is about 1/4 in. thick. Add a splash of olive oil to your cast iron, and wipe out the excess quickly. 
                    Now add your dough disk to the heated cast iron (this is the fun and challenging part.) 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once your dough begins to form visible bubbles (or after roughly 30 seconds,) flip it for the first time. Ideally it will be slightly golden with small black freckles once flipped. 
                    Let it stay on this side until the steam starts to diminish (roughly 1 to 2 minutes.) Now flip it again, and let it bake for another 1 to 2 minutes (until both sides are golden with small black spots.)
                <p>
                    If the naan comes out over or under cooked, you may need to adjust your stovetop temperature or how long you are cooking it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once finished, take the naan and place it on a plate and under a towel. Repeat for however many pieces of naan are desired, the dough balls can be refrigerated.
                </p>
            </ol>

            And there we have it! Naan goes excellently with a variety of foods, humus being my personal favorite.
