            <p>Pancakes area widely appreciated breakfast food. Easily made and widely consumed, there's no food like them. 
                Today we're going to do the impossible, and improve on a classic.</p>
            <p>Here are the necessary ingredients:</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 c buttermilk</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/3 c brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 c whole wheat flour</li>
                <li>1/2 c all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/2 c + 2 tbsp quick oats</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>
            <p>Here are the cooking materials you will need:</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 separate bowls</li>
                <li>whisk</li>
                <li>pancake griddle</li>
                <li>spatula</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>
            <p>Once all necessary ingredients are gathered, here is the process we'll use to make brown sugar oat pancakes:</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>    
            <ol>
                <h2><li><strong>Combine the ingredients:</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    Whisk together the egg, oil, and buttermilk in one bowl. 
                    In the other bowl, combine salt, baking soda, brown sugar, all-purpose flour, and whole wheat flour. 
                    Add the bowl of dry ingredients to the wet ingredient bowl, and whisk together until all ingredients are fully integrated. 
                    Next, add the oats to the mixture and whisk them in.
                </p>
                <h2><li><strong>Baking your pancakes:</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    Now take your griddle, and heat it to 275 degrees Farenheight. 
                    It will be ready once water starts slowly sizzling when sprinkled on the surface. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now we are ready to cook some pancakes!! Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the griddle for every pancake 
                    (you can make them larger, this is just what I use.) 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you want to add chocolate chips, blueberries, walnuts, etc. this is the time to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let them cook until bubbles leave visible pocketmarks on the surface of the pancakes when they pop. 
                    At this point, flip them, and let them cook the rest of the way through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pancakes should come out golden-brown on both sides and roughly 1/4 in. thick. 
                    If they are darker and too thin your temperature is too high. 
                    If they are too thick or didn't cook all the way through, your temperature is too low.
                </p>
            </ol>
