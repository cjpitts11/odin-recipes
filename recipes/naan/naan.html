            <p>Naan is a traditional flatbread found in many parts of the world, and today we're going to make the stovetop version of it!</p>
            <p>Here are the necessary ingredients:</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 c of flour (any regular flour will work, but for best results use 1.5 cups of whole wheat and 1.5 cups of all-purpose)</li>
                <li>1 c of lukewarm water (roughly 100 Farenheight)</li>
                <li>2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
                <li>1 to 2 tsp salt</li>
                <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>
            <p>Here are the cooking materials you will need:</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            <ul>
                <li>whisk</li>
                <li>wooden spoon</li>
                <li>large bowl</li>
                <li>cast iorn skillet</li>
            </ul>
        </h3>
        <h2>
            <p>Once all necessary ingredients are gathered, here is the process we'll use to make naan:</p>
        </h2>
        <h3>    
            <ol>
                <h2><li><strong>proofing the yeast:</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    Whisk together sugar, water, and yeast until the solids are dissolved. Once they are dissolved, add half a cup of flour and stir it in. 
                    Leave this bowl uncovered for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the mixture starts to take on a slightly foamy texture. 
                    If at the end of the time the mixture has't started growing in this way, your yeast and you should restart with fresh yeast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this step may seem unnecessary, it will ensure that you're not wasting your time with bread that won't rise.
                </p>
                <h2><li><strong>making the dough</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    After the yeast has been proofed, add the next 2 cups of flour to the mixture along with your salt and olive oil, 
                    leaving the last 1/2 cup on the side. Then stir with a wooden spoon until the flour has been incorporated into your mixture. 
                    At this point, your dough will be slighly flaky but there shouldn't be any mositure in the bowl oustide the dough.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now after sprinkling a small amount of flour in the bowl, knead the dough for about a minute in your bowl, 
                    incorporating as much of the residual dough on the sides of the bowl as possible. 
                    After this, sprinkle a small amount of the flour on a clean countertop and drop the dough onto this flour. 
                    Knead the dough for roughly two minutes, adding flour as the dough begins to stick to the countertop. 
                    Cover the dough and let it rest for ten minutes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the dough has rested, knead it for five minutes using the same method as before. 
                    After the five minutes have elapsed, pour a small amount of olive oil into your bowl and spread it over the entire inside surface of your bowl. 
                    Drop your dough into the bowl, and flip it a few times to coat the entirity of your dough in oil. 
                    Cover your bowl with a towel and let it rise for one hour.
                </p>
                <h2><li><strong>prepping your naan</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    Once your dough has risen for the hour, gently squish it down, it should end up losing about half its volume. 
                    Take the dough and drop it on a clean counter with a sprinkling of flour. 
                    Now separate your dough in 7 to 8 secitons with roughly the same size (I do this part by hand, but it would be easier with a dough cutter.) 
                    Roll these sections into smaller balls, and cover with a towel and let rest for about ten minutes.
                </p>
                <h2><li><strong>cooking your naan</strong></li></h2>
                <p>
                    While your naan is resting this final time is the best time to prepare to cook your naan. 
                    Put your cast iron on the stovetop, and bring it up to a medium high heat. 
                    You will know when your skillet is ready when you sprinkle it with a small splash of water and it instanly sizzles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, roll your naan bread to a disc that is about 1/4 in. thick. Add a splash of olive oil to your cast iron, and wipe out the excess quickly. 
                    Now add your dough disk to the heated cast iron (this is the fun and challenging part.) 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once your dough begins to form visible bubbles (or after roughly 30 seconds,) flip it for the first time. Ideally it will be slightly golden with small black freckles once flipped. 
                    Let it stay on this side until the steam starts to diminish (roughly 1 to 2 minutes.) Now flip it again, and let it bake for another 1 to 2 minutes (until both sides are golden with small black spots.)
                <p>
                    If the naan comes out over or under cooked, you may need to adjust your stovetop temperature or how long you are cooking it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once finished, take the naan and place it on a plate and under a towel. Repeat for however many pieces of naan are desired, the dough balls can be refrigerated.
                </p>
            </ol>

            And there we have it! Naan goes excellently with a variety of foods, humus being my personal favorite.
